# Robo Financial Advisor Process

This document outlines the process for developing a robo financial advisor that leverages technical analysis, NLP, sentiment analysis, backtesting, and automated trading using Alpaca's API. Each step is designed to work together to create a robust and data-driven trading strategy.

## Step 1: Data Collection

**Purpose**:  
The data collection step is the foundation of the robo financial advisor process. It involves gathering the necessary historical and real-time market data, as well as financial news articles, to feed into subsequent analysis steps. This step ensures that the strategy is based on comprehensive and up-to-date information.

**Implementation**:
- **Historical Data**: Use Alpaca's API to download historical stock prices and market data. This includes open, high, low, close prices, and volume information for each stock.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetch the latest market data using Alpaca’s API to make informed trading decisions based on current market conditions.
- **Financial News**: Collect financial news articles using the Financial Modeling Prep API. This provides the textual data needed for sentiment analysis and NLP tasks.
- **Considerations**: Ensure that data collection is performed within the limits of your Alpaca subscription, and consider alternative data sources if needed.



## Step 2: Technical Analysis

**Purpose**:  
The technical analysis step focuses on analyzing historical stock price data to identify patterns and trends. Technical indicators such as Simple Moving Average (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are calculated to generate trading signals.

**Implementation**:
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: Calculate the 50-day SMA to identify potential buy and sell signals based on trend direction.
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Compute the 14-day RSI to detect overbought and oversold conditions, which may indicate reversals.
- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: Use MACD to identify momentum shifts in stock prices and confirm trends.
- **Signal Generation**: Combine the technical indicators to create a composite signal for each stock, guiding trading decisions.


## Step 3: NLP and Sentiment Analysis

**Purpose**:  
The NLP and sentiment analysis step involves processing unstructured text data from financial news articles to gauge market sentiment. This step provides qualitative insights that complement the quantitative analysis performed in technical analysis.

**Implementation**:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Use pre-trained models to assess the sentiment of financial news articles, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extract key entities such as organizations and individuals mentioned in news articles to understand context.
- **News Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of lengthy news articles to quickly extract key information.
- **Financial Sentiment**: Apply FinBERT or similar models to specifically analyze financial sentiment, providing more accurate insights for financial contexts.



## Step 4: Backtesting

**Purpose**:  
Backtesting is the process of evaluating the trading strategy using historical data to assess its effectiveness. By simulating trades based on past data, you can determine the strategy's profitability, risk, and potential areas for improvement.

**Implementation**:
- **Strategy Rules**: Define clear entry and exit rules based on the signals generated from technical and sentiment analysis.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculate key metrics such as total return, annualized return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown to evaluate strategy performance.
- **Visualization**: Plot cumulative returns and drawdowns over time to visually assess the strategy's performance.
- **Refinement**: Use insights from backtesting to refine and optimize the trading strategy for better results.


## Step 5: Trading Strategy Implementation with Alpaca

**Purpose**:  
The final step involves implementing the trading strategy in a live environment using Alpaca’s API. The strategy is executed automatically based on the signals generated from previous analysis steps, allowing for real-time trading decisions.

**Implementation**:
- **API Integration**: Use Alpaca’s API to place buy and sell orders, manage positions, and monitor account status in a paper trading environment.
- **Entry and Exit Rules**: Implement the defined strategy rules for entering and exiting trades based on technical and sentiment signals.
- **Risk Management**: Apply risk management techniques, such as position sizing and stop-loss orders, to protect the portfolio.
- **Execution Loop**: Set up a loop to periodically evaluate the strategy, update data, and execute trades automatically.
- **Testing and Adjustment**: Continuously monitor the strategy’s performance in paper trading and make adjustments as necessary before deploying in a live environment.
